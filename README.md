# M채rklinSim
M채rklinSim is a software simulation of a M채rklin train set. It accepts train set commands through a TCP port
or a Unix domain socket, instead of serial I/O which the real M채rklin train controller uses.

The default setup is a copy of the ones in UWaterloo MC3018 (aka the train lab).
